## INTRODUCTION TO DATA AND DATA ANALYSIS

Hello everyone! 

I have always wondered how beautiful it would be to share what you learn and recently discovered how blogging perfectly puts the frame in place. I recently started studying Data Analytics from the famous [**Google Analytics Course from Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). I decided to record my footprints of learning digitally. So, let's begin!!!

Data was always around us, but the craze to understand and draw conclusions from data suddenly has peaked. So, the main question is, **"What is Data?"**

**Data** is nothing but the collection of facts.
So what is **Data Analysis**? And what do **Data Analysts** do?

**Data Analysis** is data collection, transformation and organization to conclude, make predictions and drive informed decision-making.

**Data Analysts** are people who collect, transform and organize data to help make informed decisions.

In some ways or other, we all have been in the shoes of a Data Analyst? You will ask how? Have you ever bought something from an e-commerce store but, before that, went through the ratings and comments of previous buyers? Have you compared two movies before purchasing tickets based on IMDb Ratings, your free time and price? Have you seen the crime rates reported in the newspaper and been happy that CCTV cameras in your areas have drastically reduced crimes? If yes, then you have already done data analysis subconsciously.

Similarly, in industry, the field of Data Analysis can be applied in:
1. *Finance:* Growth of a company studied through the history of its stock market prices
2. *Healthcare:* To study and predict diseases from their early symptoms.
3. *Communications:* From overloading the data wires and requirement analysis of people to the number of towers required in an area.
4. *Government:* From crime rates to population rates to popularity polls, multiple things are dependent on correct data analysis
5. *Consumer Products:* Testing a new product before launch and studying the acceptance rate of people.

Businesses need data to usually improve processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, serve customers, make thoughtful decisions and much more. It's not just that businesses need data to improve their interactions and their products for their clients. They need data to improve interaction with their employees too. It is also known as **People Analytics**.

**People Analytics** is otherwise known as *human resource analytics* or *workforce analytics*. This technique is used to gain insights into how the company operates and is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce.

It is all about what we need to know to learn about data. In the next blog, I will view the various life-cycles of data. How even data is alive, and how diverse job roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer and Data Analyst are closely linked yet entirely different.

Thanks for reading! ❤️
